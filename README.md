# Low-cost_smart_footwear_for_remote_gait_monitoring_of_incomplete_spinal_cord_injured_patients
The present invention discloses a Smart Foot Wear to assess the rehabilitation progress of individuals suffering from spinal cord injuries (SCI). Body-mounted sensors, including Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), offer a cost-effective means of measuring gait parameters, with the Foot Trajectory algorithm demonstrating efficacy in determining gait speed and stride length. Previous research highlights the promise of smart Footwear in quantifying gait characteristics and identifying subtle changes during rehabilitation. However, detecting initial and end contacts in gait monitoring, particularly in spinal cord-injured patients, remains crucial. To address this, a shank-mounted IMU system and a standalone IMU-based insole system have been developed, achieving accurate gait event detection of SCI patients.

Commercially available IMU sensors are susceptible to environmental noise, necessitating robust methods for event detection. The Smart Foot Wear features a sensor ensemble strategically integrated within the footwear's design enabling precise capture of foot-specific movement data, facilitating measurement of key gait parameters such as stride length, gait speed, and cadence with consistent data when walking in a straight path. Designed for ease of use in clinical and home-based settings, its cost-effective design offers a portable alternative to conventional gait analysis systems. Real-time data transfer to a cloud platform enables visualization and comparison of gait parameters over time, aiding therapists in monitoring patient progress.
